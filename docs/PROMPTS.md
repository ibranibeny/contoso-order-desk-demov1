# Prompts and prepared text for the live demo

Copy-paste text for each step of [the live demo guide](LIVE-DEMO-GUIDE.md). Replace `<owner>/<repo>` and the issue numbers with yours.

## 0. Business requirement

Read it aloud at the start, and paste it into prompt 1.

> Our agents answer a lot of "where is my order?" calls, and today they search several systems to find one order. We need a simple **Order Desk**: an agent types an order number and immediately sees the order status and estimated delivery date. Unknown or mistyped numbers must show a clear message. Agents must not see payment details, and every lookup must be recorded for audit.

## 1. Create the issue with Copilot

Where: <https://github.com/copilot> (Copilot Chat on GitHub.com). Creating issues with Copilot is in public preview.

```text
In <owner>/<repo>, create a feature issue from the requirement below using our Feature request form.
Write testable acceptance criteria, and create sub-issues for: (1) the order lookup API,
(2) the agent lookup page, (3) an audit log of every lookup.

Our agents answer a lot of "where is my order?" calls, and today they search several systems to find
one order. We need a simple Order Desk: an agent types an order number and immediately sees the order
status and estimated delivery date. Unknown or mistyped numbers must show a clear message. Agents must
not see payment details, and every lookup must be recorded for audit.
```

Expect a draft parent issue with the form's sections filled in, plus three draft sub-issues. Review and edit before you select **Create**.

## 2. Assign the page to Copilot

Where: sub-issue **Agent lookup page** → **Assignees → Copilot** → optional prompt.

```text
Build the agent lookup page in public/ with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Another pull request is
building the API; code against this contract: GET /api/orders/:orderId returns 200 with
{ id, status, lastUpdated, estimatedDelivery }, 400 for invalid IDs and 404 with { error } when not found.
Do not add or change server routes. Use the Contoso design system in public/styles.css and keep the
existing top bar and footer. Show a clear message for unknown order numbers, make the form keyboard
accessible, and add unit tests for the formatting helpers.
```

## 3. Plan mode in VS Code

Where: Copilot Chat in VS Code, **Plan**, on branch `feature/order-lookup-api`.

```text
Plan the order lookup API from issue #13: GET /api/orders/:orderId returns id, status, lastUpdated and
estimatedDelivery from data/orders.json; 400 when the ID doesn't match ORD- plus six digits; 404 with a
JSON error for unknown IDs. List the files you will change and the tests you will add.
```

## 4. Agent mode in VS Code

Where: switch the same chat to **Agent**.

```text
Implement the plan. Then run npm test and fix any failures.
```

Then, in Source Control: **Generate commit message** → commit → push → create the pull request. Make sure the description contains:

```text
Fixes #13
```

## 5. Iterate on Copilot's pull request

Where: a comment on the cloud agent's pull request for the page.

```text
@copilot Show the estimated delivery date in a friendly format such as "5 Nov 2026", and add a test for it.
```

## 6. Prepared issue text (fallback for prompt 1)

Use **New issue → Feature request** and paste these, or run `scripts/create-demo-issues.sh` before the session.

**Title:** `[Feature]: Order Desk: look up an order's status and delivery date`

| Form field | Text |
|---|---|
| Business problem | Customer care agents answer a lot of "where is my order?" calls, and today they search several systems to find one order. |
| Desired outcome | A simple Order Desk: an agent types an order number and immediately sees the order status and estimated delivery date. |
| Acceptance criteria | - Given a valid order number (ORD- followed by six digits), the agent sees the order status and the estimated delivery date<br>- An unknown order number shows a clear "not found" message<br>- A mistyped order number shows a clear message that explains the expected format<br>- Agents never see payment details or customer contact details<br>- Every lookup is recorded for audit |
| Data sensitivity | Payment data |
| Non-functional requirements | A lookup answers in under one second. The page works with the keyboard and a screen reader. Lookups are recorded for audit. |

**Sub-issue 1: Order lookup API**

```markdown
Build `GET /api/orders/:orderId`, reading `data/orders.json`.

### Acceptance criteria

- 200 with only `id`, `status`, `lastUpdated` and `estimatedDelivery` for a known order
- 400 with `{ "error": "Order numbers look like ORD-123456" }` when the ID is not ORD- followed by six digits
- 404 with `{ "error": "Order not found" }` for an unknown order
- No payment or customer contact fields in any response
- Tests for success, 400 and 404
```

**Sub-issue 2: Agent lookup page**

```markdown
Replace the placeholder in `public/index.html` with an order lookup page for customer care agents.

### Acceptance criteria

- A labelled "Order number" field and a Look up button that work with the keyboard only
- Shows the status and estimated delivery date from `GET /api/orders/:orderId` (built in the API sub-issue): 200 returns `{ id, status, lastUpdated, estimatedDelivery }`, 400 and 404 return `{ error }`
- Unknown order numbers show a clear not-found message; mistyped ones explain the expected format
- Uses the Contoso design system in `public/styles.css`
- Unit tests for the formatting helpers
```

**Sub-issue 3: Audit log of order lookups** (stays open for Session 6)

```markdown
Record every order lookup for audit: who looked up which order, when, and the result.

### Acceptance criteria

- Each lookup writes an audit record with a timestamp, the agent's identity, the order number and the result (found, not found or invalid)
- Audit records never contain customer contact or payment details
- Audit records can be listed for one order number
```

## 7. Order numbers to try in the live app

| Order | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `ORD-100232` | Out for delivery, arriving on the demo day |
| `ORD-100231` | Packed, delivery in two days |
| `ORD-100233` | Delivered two days ago |
| `ORD-100234` | Payment pending, delivery not scheduled yet |
| `ORD-999999` | Not found |
| `12345` | Invalid format |
| `100232` | The page accepts the six digits alone and fills in `ORD-` |

Dates are relative to the demo day the data was generated for (3 November 2026 by default). To make "today" match your demo, run `DEMO_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD scripts/github-setup.sh` (add `APPROVER=<approver>` if a second person approves) a few days before: it regenerates `data/orders.json` for that day, commits it to main, and moves the `demo-start` tag. Then redeploy (Actions → CI/CD → Run workflow).

## 8. Agentic workflows

Where: GitHub Copilot CLI, or agent mode in VS Code, with the `agentic-workflows` skill (`gh aw init` adds it to a repository). Copilot asks a few questions, writes the workflow, compiles it with `gh aw compile` and opens a pull request. This repository already contains both results; see [Agentic SDLC](../README.md#agentic-sdlc) for what they do and the secrets they need.

The daily activity report:

```text
/agentic-workflows Create a new workflow that creates a daily report on recent activity in the repository,
delivered as an issue.
```

The daily SDLC health check, the operate stage of the agentic SDLC:

```text
/agentic-workflows Create a new workflow that runs every day and checks what needs fixing in this repository:
builds on main (the latest run of every workflow, and runs waiting for an approval), code reviews (open pull
requests with unresolved review threads, changes requested, failing checks, conflicts, or waiting more than a
day for a review) and GitHub Advanced Security (open code scanning, Dependabot and secret scanning alerts).
When something needs fixing, raise one daily report issue and one Copilot-ready issue per new problem on main,
with the evidence, a suggested fix and when it counts as done. Never raise the same problem twice, close a fix
issue once its problem is gone, never put a secret value in an issue, and write nothing when all is healthy.
```

Then close the loop: open a fix issue and select **Assignees → Copilot**.
